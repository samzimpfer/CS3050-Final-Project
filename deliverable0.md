### Project Specs

We will be designing a Settlers of Catan game for our final project. We plan to code the game using mostly python. For graphics we are likely going to use the Pygame package, but due to the complex nature of the board for Settlers of Catan, we may opt to use a different graphics package, such as Python Arcade, if it offers better support for complex component rendering/positioning.

The user will be able to interact with all components of the board, including individual spaces, edges, and vertices. We will implement an AI opponent(s) which will be able to play at a reasonable skill level against a human. Since there is some long term strategy involved in the real game of Settlers of Catan, we may modify the rules to prevent trading and not implement the robber, so that the AI is a better match for the user.
